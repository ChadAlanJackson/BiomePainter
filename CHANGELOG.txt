0.2 - 3/30/2012
    * Replaced trackbars with scrollbars for panning.
        - Also after mousing over or clicking on the image the arrow keys can
          be used to pan up, down, left, and right.
    * Zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel.
        - For example, if you want to zoom into a particular area in the
          region, hold the cursor over it and scroll up.
    * Undo and redo changes to selection and biomes.
        - Undo history is cleared when closing or opening a world.
        - Changes to biomes are removed from the undo history when changing
          regions within a world, though selection changes are left.
    * Copy biomes under the current selection and paste them elsewhere.
        - Currently when pasting you must specify the coordinates to paste to,
          relative to 0, 0 at the top-left corner of the region. The default is
          the coordinates of the top-left corner of what was copied. So,
          copying and immediately pasting won't actually change anything.
    * Menu items for selection operations in addition to buttons.
    * Shortcut keys for menu items.
    * New overlay: chunk boundaries, hidden by default.
    * Fixed mouse movements and clicks registering in wrong location when
      zoomed in.
    * Fixed single right clicking with a brush size of 1 not erasing.
    * Removed dependencies not available under Mono.
        - Biome Painter should run without problems on platforms other than
          Windows using Mono (http://www.mono-project.com), though I have no
          way to test myself.
