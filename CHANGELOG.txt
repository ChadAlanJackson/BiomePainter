0.3 - 4/3/2012
    * "TerrainGenerated" flag on chunks can be reset from the Edit menu,
      causing the selected chunks to be filled with trees and ores the next
      time they are loaded in Minecraft. May damage existing structures in
      affected chunks, please see README.txt, the section "Points of Confusion"
      for more information.
    * Save times dramatically improved. Saving all chunks in a reigon down
      from 60 seconds to ~7 seconds in my tests.
    * Overhead map indicates hight by making higher areas lighter in color.
    * Brush visible when mousing over region map. Brush size can now be changed
      with Ctrl + Mouse Wheel.
    * More shortcut keys.
        - Use Ctrl + Up, Down, Left, or Right to switch to adjacent regions.
        - Use Ctrl + G to bring up the jump to coordinates dialog.
    * Replaced text on most buttons with an icon.
    * Manually check for an updated version of Biome Painter from the Help
      menu. A message box is displayed, however nothing is downloaded
      automatically.
    * Biome generation from Minecraft 1.2.4 relabeled 1.2.5 as they are
      identical.
    * Fixed crash bug when a chunk was all or mostly air.

0.2 - 3/30/2012
    * Replaced trackbars with scrollbars for panning.
        - Also after mousing over or clicking on the image the arrow keys can
          be used to pan up, down, left, and right.
    * Zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel.
        - For example, if you want to zoom into a particular area in the
          region, hold the cursor over it and scroll up.
    * Undo and redo changes to selection and biomes.
        - Undo history is cleared when closing or opening a world.
        - Changes to biomes are removed from the undo history when changing
          regions within a world, though selection changes are left.
    * Copy biomes under the current selection and paste them elsewhere.
        - Currently when pasting you must specify the coordinates to paste to,
          relative to 0, 0 at the top-left corner of the region. The default is
          the coordinates of the top-left corner of what was copied. So,
          copying and immediately pasting won't actually change anything.
    * Menu items for selection operations in addition to buttons.
    * Shortcut keys for menu items.
    * New overlay: chunk boundaries, hidden by default.
    * Fixed mouse movements and clicks registering in wrong location when
      zoomed in.
    * Fixed single right clicking with a brush size of 1 not erasing.
    * Removed dependencies not available under Mono.
        - Biome Painter should run without problems on platforms other than
          Windows using Mono (http://www.mono-project.com), though I have no
          way to test myself.
