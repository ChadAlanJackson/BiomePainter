1.0 - 12/25/2012
    * Check for updates window now has separate options for block colors, biome
      definitions, and the program itself. The first two can download updates on
      demand. The last will open a web page with links to download the updated
      version.
    * Block colors are now split between two files: Blocks.default.txt and
      Blocks.user.txt. The former shouldn't be edited manually. Updated
      versions of the file can be downloaded from the "Check for updates"
      option in the Help menu. This checks the Blocks.default.txt file on
      GitHub.com, which will be updated with new blocks as they're added to the
      game. Entries in Blocks.user.txt will never be overwritten by Biome
      Painter and always override values in Blocks.default.txt.
    * Biome definitions and colors are now split between two files:
      Biomes.default.txt and Biomes.user.txt. See the description of the new
      separate files for block colors, above.
    * A save's level.dat can now be "open[ed] with" Biome Painter.
        - After this has been done at least once, worlds opened with Biome
          Painter from the file system or through the standard open file window
          from within the program will be automatically added to the program's
          jump list and list of recent files in the start menu in Windows 7 or
          later. Other platforms are not affected.
    * Undo and redo buttons and menu items are now disabled when there's nothing
      for them to do. The buttons also have a tooltip when hovering over them
      describing what they would undo or redo when clicked.
    * A world's seed can be changed from the file menu. This affects filling or
      replacing with biomes from a given version of Minecraft.
        - A different seed can be used temporarily while the world is open in
          Biome Painter with the option to also save the new seed to level.dat.
    * Display world name in program title bar
    * Ability to fill or replace with biomes from Minecraft 1.4.6.
        - Separate Minecraft 1.4.6 large biomes option.
        - Minecraft versions now in descending order in drop down lists.
    * Checking for updates now faster.
    * Reading region files now faster.
    * More robust searching for directories containing region files and
      handling dimensions that have none.

0.9 - 9/12/2012
    * Terrain map layer now supports transparent blocks and biome colors for
      grass and leaves. These both make rendering the map slower, however.
      Options to enable or disable these features can be found under the new
      "Settings" menu. Additionally there's an option to control whether the
      terrain map should be re-generated after every biome change, though that
      would be unnecessary without the biome foliage option enabled.
    * A list of the ten most recently opened worlds can be found under the File
      menu.
        - Settings and recent worlds are stored in settings.xml, wherever
          BiomePainter.exe is located.
    * Block colors used in the terrain map are read from a file, Blocks.txt.
      Each line should be formatted:
        - blockId[:dataValue][,additionalIds];[optional comma-separated biome
          ids;]6-8 digit hex color code [aa]rrggbb #optional comment
    * Errors are logged to text files saved wherever BiomePainter.exe is found.
      Nothing is transmitted automatically, however these could be useful in
      reporting any crashes.
    * Ability to fill or replace with biomes from Minecraft 1.3.2.
        - Separate Minecraft 1.3.2 large biomes option.
        - Also added biome generation from BETA 1.3_01 per request. Sorry it
          took so long.
    * Program components combined into fewer, larger DLLs.

0.8 - 4/20/2012
    * Batch processing of an entire dimension of an entire world can now be
      done from the Edit menu after opening a world and selecting biomes from
      the drop down lists at the bottom of the main window.
        - Biomes to be used are taken from the existing drop down lists at the
          bottom of the main window.
        - When canceling a job in progress, if a region has begun to be saved
          it is allowed to finish before everything is stopped in order to
          prevent corrupting save files.
    * Pasting now allows mousing over and clicking on the region to place the
      copied biomes instead of typing coordinates.
        - To cancel a paste press Escape, or switch which brush type is
          selected.
    * Fixed reloading the current region when none is loaded.

0.7 - 4/16/2012
    * Two new brush types: rectangle select and fill.
        - Fill or clear a rectangular area by clicking and dragging using the
          left or right mouse button.
        - Flood fill an area on the selection layer by clicking inside it.
    * Copying and pasting now uses operating system's clipboard.
    * List of regions now sorted: x negative to positive, z negative to
      positive.
    * Brush layer now displayed on top of selection layer.
    * Max brush diameter increased from 50 pixels to 100.
    * Tooltips now hidden when drawing, in addition to mouse cursor.
    * Added support for upcoming changes to world directory structure.
    * Added colors for some additional block types for terrain map.
    * Fixed data values for blocks on terrain map being read incorrectly.
    * Fixed End region directory not being found.
    * Fixed mouse clicks registering on tooltip instead of region image.

0.6 - 4/11/2012
    * Two chunks into the eight regions adjacent to the currently loaded one
      are now displayed around the edge of the region map. They are read-only
      and cannot be selected. Their purpose is to help with lining up changes
      to biomes that straddle region borders.
    * Regions from the Nether or End can be loaded by switching dimensions from
      the file menu after opening a world.
    * Biomes that can be edited with this program are now read from a text
      file, Biomes.txt, sitting in the same directory as Biome Painter. The
      format for each line is: [biome id (0-255)],[biome display name],
      [6-digit hexadecimal color code for the overlay map]. The biome id is the
      important part and what is recorded in your region files. For more
      information, see: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_values#Biome_IDs

0.5 - 4/9/2012
    * New option to add to or remove from the current selection based on
      existing biomes in the region. For instance, the ability to add every 
      area that is currently taiga to the current selection.
    * Number keys now toggle layers on and off.
    * While zoomed in, use Alt + Mouse Wheel to pan up and down, and Shift +
      Mouse Wheel to pan left and right. As before, Ctrl + Mouse Wheel
      adjusts brush size and Mouse Wheel by itself adjusts magnification.
    * Mouse cursor is now hidden while drawing or erasing.
    * Fixed panning left or up not working when viewing the bottom-right corner
      of the region.

0.4 - 4/6/2012
    * Replaced layer visibility checkboxes with toggle buttons with icons
      instead of text labels.
    * New option to add to or remove from the current selection based on blocks
      on the surface of the region. For instance, the ability to add the area
      over all grass blocks to the current selection.
    * Added buttons beneath the list of regions for switching to adjacent
      regions or jumping to a region that contains a set of coordinates.
    * Fixed dead shrubs not being displayed on the map layer.
    * Fixed magnification slider and label not updating when switching regions
      while zoomed in.

0.3 - 4/3/2012
    * "TerrainGenerated" flag on chunks can be reset from the Edit menu,
      causing the selected chunks to be filled with trees and ores the next
      time they are loaded in Minecraft. May damage existing structures in
      affected chunks, please see README.txt, the section "Points of Confusion"
      for more information.
    * Save times dramatically improved. Saving all chunks in a region down
      from 60 seconds to ~7 seconds in my tests.
    * Overhead map indicates height by making higher areas lighter in color.
    * Brush visible when mousing over region map. Brush size can now be changed
      with Ctrl + Mouse Wheel.
    * More shortcut keys.
        - Use Ctrl + Up, Down, Left, or Right to switch to adjacent regions.
        - Use Ctrl + G to bring up the jump to coordinates dialog.
    * Replaced text on most buttons with an icon.
    * Manually check for an updated version of Biome Painter from the Help
      menu. A message box is displayed, however nothing is downloaded
      automatically.
    * Biome generation from Minecraft 1.2.4 relabeled 1.2.5 as they are
      identical.
    * Fixed crash bug when a chunk was all or mostly air.

0.2 - 3/30/2012
    * Replaced trackbars with scrollbars for panning.
        - Also after mousing over or clicking on the image the arrow keys can
          be used to pan up, down, left, and right.
    * Zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel.
        - For example, if you want to zoom into a particular area in the
          region, hold the cursor over it and scroll up.
    * Undo and redo changes to selection and biomes.
        - Undo history is cleared when closing or opening a world.
        - Changes to biomes are removed from the undo history when changing
          regions within a world, though selection changes are left.
    * Copy biomes under the current selection and paste them elsewhere.
        - Currently when pasting you must specify the coordinates to paste to,
          relative to 0, 0 at the top-left corner of the region. The default is
          the coordinates of the top-left corner of what was copied. So,
          copying and immediately pasting won't actually change anything.
    * Menu items for selection operations in addition to buttons.
    * Shortcut keys for menu items.
    * New overlay: chunk boundaries, hidden by default.
    * Fixed mouse movements and clicks registering in wrong location when
      zoomed in.
    * Fixed single right clicking with a brush size of 1 not erasing.
    * Removed dependencies not available under Mono.
        - Biome Painter should run without problems on platforms other than
          Windows using Mono (http://www.mono-project.com), though I have no
          way to test myself.

0.1 - 3/25/2012
    * First release.
