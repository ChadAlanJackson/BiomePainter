0.6 - 4/11/2012
    * Two chunks into the eight regions adjacent to the currently loaded one
      are now displayed around the edge of the region map. They are read-only
      and cannot be selected. Their purpose is to help with lining up changes
      to biomes that straddle region borders.
    * Regions from the Nether or End can be loaded by switching dimensions from
      the file menu after opening a world.
    * Biomes that can be edited with this program are now read from a text
      file, Biomes.txt, sitting in the same directory as Biome Painter. The
      format for each line is: [biome id (0-255)],[biome display name],
      [6-digit hexadecimal color code for the overlay map]. The biome id is the
      important part and what is recorded in your region files. For more
      information, see: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Data_values#Biome_IDs

0.5 - 4/9/2012
    * New option to add to or remove from the current selection based on
      existing biomes in the region. For instance, the ability to add every 
      area that is currently taiga to the current selection.
    * Number keys now toggle layers on and off.
    * While zoomed in, use Alt + Mouse Wheel to pan up and down, and Shift +
      Mosue Wheel to pan left and right. As before, Ctrl + Mouse Wheel
      adjusts brush size and Mouse Wheel by itself adjusts magnification.
    * Mouse cursor is now hidden while drawing or erasing.
    * Fixed panning left or up not working when viewing the bottom-right corner
      of the region.

0.4 - 4/6/2012
    * Replaced layer visibility checkboxes with toggle buttons with icons
      instead of text labels.
    * New option to add to or remove from the current selection based on blocks
      on the surface of the region. For instance, the ability to add the area
      over all grass blocks to the current selection.
    * Added buttons beneath the list of regions for switching to adjacent
      regions or jumping to a region that contains a set of coordinates.
    * Fixed dead shrubs not being displayed on the map layer.
    * Fixed magnification slider and label not updating when switching regions
      while zoomed in.

0.3 - 4/3/2012
    * "TerrainGenerated" flag on chunks can be reset from the Edit menu,
      causing the selected chunks to be filled with trees and ores the next
      time they are loaded in Minecraft. May damage existing structures in
      affected chunks, please see README.txt, the section "Points of Confusion"
      for more information.
    * Save times dramatically improved. Saving all chunks in a reigon down
      from 60 seconds to ~7 seconds in my tests.
    * Overhead map indicates hight by making higher areas lighter in color.
    * Brush visible when mousing over region map. Brush size can now be changed
      with Ctrl + Mouse Wheel.
    * More shortcut keys.
        - Use Ctrl + Up, Down, Left, or Right to switch to adjacent regions.
        - Use Ctrl + G to bring up the jump to coordinates dialog.
    * Replaced text on most buttons with an icon.
    * Manually check for an updated version of Biome Painter from the Help
      menu. A message box is displayed, however nothing is downloaded
      automatically.
    * Biome generation from Minecraft 1.2.4 relabeled 1.2.5 as they are
      identical.
    * Fixed crash bug when a chunk was all or mostly air.

0.2 - 3/30/2012
    * Replaced trackbars with scrollbars for panning.
        - Also after mousing over or clicking on the image the arrow keys can
          be used to pan up, down, left, and right.
    * Zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel.
        - For example, if you want to zoom into a particular area in the
          region, hold the cursor over it and scroll up.
    * Undo and redo changes to selection and biomes.
        - Undo history is cleared when closing or opening a world.
        - Changes to biomes are removed from the undo history when changing
          regions within a world, though selection changes are left.
    * Copy biomes under the current selection and paste them elsewhere.
        - Currently when pasting you must specify the coordinates to paste to,
          relative to 0, 0 at the top-left corner of the region. The default is
          the coordinates of the top-left corner of what was copied. So,
          copying and immediately pasting won't actually change anything.
    * Menu items for selection operations in addition to buttons.
    * Shortcut keys for menu items.
    * New overlay: chunk boundaries, hidden by default.
    * Fixed mouse movements and clicks registering in wrong location when
      zoomed in.
    * Fixed single right clicking with a brush size of 1 not erasing.
    * Removed dependencies not available under Mono.
        - Biome Painter should run without problems on platforms other than
          Windows using Mono (http://www.mono-project.com), though I have no
          way to test myself.

0.1 - 3/25/2012
